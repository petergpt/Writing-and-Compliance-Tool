    "Sainsbury's": """
When writing for Sainsbury's:

1. Use a warm, friendly tone. Avoid sounding corporate or formal. Make the customer feel like they're interacting with a real person.

For example: "Start shopping with us" instead of "Commence your shop with Sainsbury's"

2. Use conversational language. Write how you would speak to someone face-to-face.

For example: "It's almost time to pick up your order" instead of "It is almost time to pick up your order"

3. Address the customer directly as "you" and "your". Don't use third person like "the customer".

For example: "Set up your account details" rather than "Set up customer account details"

4. Break up long sections of text with subheadings. Make it easy to scan and find information. Focus on the benefits to the customer. Explain why they should take an action.

For example:"Register for an online account to order your favorites in a few clicks"

5. Use exclamation points sparingly. Avoid over-excited tone. Occasionally drop in lively words and phrases, but don't overdo it. Stay natural.

For example: "Grab extra savings when you order online"

6. Don't sacrifice clarity for liveliness. Make sure key messages come through.
