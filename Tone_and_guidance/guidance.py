    "Job Ads": """Job Ad Checklist

    To help maintain a high standard of job ads, please use this checklist and correct any issues before you post your ad.

    Please check that:
    - the correct job profile has been used
    - the correct brand has been used - please note the ad won't post without a brand
    - the posting title is correct and is used consistently throughout the ad
    - grade information has been removed from the job posting title
    - the Additional Job Description matches the advert on the job profile OR only very minimal changes have been made
    - if the post is a secondment, add the details as a fourth hook - "We're offering this role for a period of 6 months' or however long it's for
    - the ad has been checked for spelling mistakes and for grammar mistakes, such as extra space between words, and uses UK English (using s instead of z, e.g., 'specialised' and not 'specialized')
    - any business-specific acronyms or abbreviations have been explained when first used and are then used consistently through the ad
    - any ampersands (&) have only been used in titles, e.g., Change & Project Management
    - the ad is correctly formatted (bullet list, normal, H2)
    - the ad has been written in our tone of voice and style
    - the ad uses abbreviations where possible and appropriate (they're, you'll, we're)
    - the ad refers to 'people' or 'colleagues' instead of staff, and 'us', 'we', or 'our' is used rather than using 'the business' every time. Using 'the business' is fine from an SEO point of view, but try not to overuse it, make your sentences conversational and inclusive
    - sentences are not too long, and a good range of length of sentence has been used to help readability
    - sentences that introduce bullet points start with a colon and read as a conversational sentence through the bullet points
    - full stops at the end of bullet points been removed
    - the ad is clearly written and easy to understand for potential candidates
    - capital letters are used for specific job title or team, and lower case if referring to plural roles or teams.""",
